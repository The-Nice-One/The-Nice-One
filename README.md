I am currently working on my first main project .spf (SimplePixelFont) files. These files store pixelated fonts that are small in byte size yet still provide a lot of flexibility. You can check out a working example of these files at [https://the-nice-one.github.io/web-spf/](https://the-nice-one.github.io/web-spf/).
